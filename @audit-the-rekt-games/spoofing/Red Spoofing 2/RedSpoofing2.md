# Red Spoofing 2 ðŸ”€ - 100 Points

Having successfully created a spoofed address that resembles the target receiver in the previous challenge, itâ€™s time to move forward and complete the PoC.

In a real-world scenario, attackers may conduct a zero-token transfer to mimic a legitimate transaction and increase their credibility in the eyes of unsuspecting users. By copying all transaction details, except for the recipient address, attackers can simulate a seemingly authentic token transfer.

## Task

Now that you've generated a spoofed address, it's time to initiate the next step in this PoC of transaction spoofing.

Perform a 0-value token transfer in the tesnet. It should resemble the token transfer in the same transaction we saw in the first part:

`holesky-0x28e46dc92cd9a2df7776138d4a722ed474309569181e25465d2005a7090097a2`

The main difference will be the recipient address, which should now be an spoofed address (at least first and last 3 characters equal to the receiver), and the amount that should be 0.

Note: for this challenge you'll first need to get some Holesky ETH to pay for the gas of your transaction

## Flag

Once you successfully executed the 0-value token transfer in Holesky testnet, follow the instructions on this page to retrieve the flag:

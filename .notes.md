Calldata Detective 🕵️

10

As a member of a prominent DAO's multisig, you've just received an urgent email from a fellow council member:

"Hey! We need your signature ASAP for this routine maintenance transaction. Nothing major, just some standard updates. Could you sign it right away?"

The transaction's calldata looks innocent enough: 0xf2fde38b000000000000000000000000098b716b8aaf21512996dc57eb0615e2383e2f96

But something feels off about the urgency. Before blindly signing, maybe you should decode what this transaction actually does...

Task
Decode the transaction's calldata to reveal its true purpose. What exactly are you being asked to sign?

Flag
A human-readable description of the function call, like: transfer(0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045,1000)

During the investigation of a phishing campaign, someone on X shared this calldata of an Ethereum transaction. They lost the tx hash, so it's hard to know more details. All we know is that it was flagged as an approval of a stablecoin by a monitoring system.

Task
Analyze the calldata to find out the token address and how many tokens the phishing victim could lose.

Flag
The token address and how many tokens the phishing victim could lose, separated by a -.

One of our ex-employees left behind a peculiar smart contract with some... interesting constraints. The contract needs to be initialized, but there's a catch - the initialization function has some tricky requirements:

// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.27;

contract Demo {
bool public initialized;
function initialize(uint256[] calldata prev, uint256[] memory next) external {
require(prev.length == next.length, "inaccurate length");
require(msg.data.length < 101, "msg too long");

       initialized = true;

}
}
We need to set initialized to true.

Task
Craft the perfect calldata that satisfies all requirements to initialize this contract.

Flag
The complete calldata starting with a function selector, such as: 0xbb4b2443...

The Intern's Vanity 🔑 (#1)

30

A new intern has joined The Red Guild's team.

Skipping the usual security onboarding, management needed a quick win and assigned the intern the first task: to generate a vanity wallet address starting with 0xc0de. This wallet will be used in the future to deploy the Guild's on-chain vault.

The intern delivered surprisingly quickly, and the deployment went ahead. But something feels off about how fast they accomplished this seemingly complex task...

Files
Vanity wallet generation script
Your task
Is the intern's wallet generation script safe? If you can uncover a security vulnerability and get the Guild wallet's private key, you'll earn the respect of the Guild.

Flag
The wallet's private key. For example:

Red Spoofing 🔀

These days scams and phishing attacks are becoming increasingly popular. So it's fundamental for security researchers to understand all the evil techniques attackers are using to do it.

In this case, a client you work for doesn't believe scams are so dangerous. So he's asked you to see a practical example of how transaction spoofing works.

Task
The client transferred a test token to another account. You must generate an address that starts and ends with 3 characters of the token receiver. Here's the transaction:

holesky-0x28e46dc92cd9a2df7776138d4a722ed474309569181e25465d2005a7090097a2

For example if the receiver is 0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045, the first 3 and last 3 characters would be d8d and 045.

Flag
For this challenge, you must generate the flag by following the instructions on this page:

Red Spoofing 2 🔀

Having successfully created a spoofed address that resembles the target receiver in the previous challenge, it’s time to move forward and complete the PoC.

In a real-world scenario, attackers may conduct a zero-token transfer to mimic a legitimate transaction and increase their credibility in the eyes of unsuspecting users. By copying all transaction details, except for the recipient address, attackers can simulate a seemingly authentic token transfer.

Task
Now that you've generated a spoofed address, it's time to initiate the next step in this PoC of transaction spoofing.

Perform a 0-value token transfer in the tesnet. It should resemble the token transfer in the same transaction we saw in the first part:

holesky-0x28e46dc92cd9a2df7776138d4a722ed474309569181e25465d2005a7090097a2

The main difference will be the recipient address, which should now be an spoofed address (at least first and last 3 characters equal to the receiver), and the amount that should be 0.

Note: for this challenge you'll first need to get some Holesky ETH to pay for the gas of your transaction.

Flag
Once you successfully executed the 0-value token transfer in Holesky testnet, follow the instructions on this page to retrieve the flag:

Red Spoofing 3 🔀

Despite your demo in the previous challenge, the client remains unconvinced that their token could be susceptible to a spoofing attack.

They argue that any attempt at a zero-value token transfer would simply revert on their soon-to-be-deployed token, due to on-chain validations. So it'd be impossible for attackers to mimic a legitimate transaction.

However, there’s ONE detail the client might be overlooking: an attacker could create a different contract, with the same symbol, name, and some events, replicating the appearance of an authentic transfer with the same amount on block explorers!

Task
Remember that the original token transfer is:

holesky-0x28e46dc92cd9a2df7776138d4a722ed474309569181e25465d2005a7090097a2

Produce a transaction that executes your contract, which must mimic the token metadata (name & symbol), transferred amount and event of the transfer of the original token.

Note: for this challenge you'll need Holesky ETH to pay for the gas of your transaction.

Flag
Once you've successfully executed the spoof token transfer in Holesky testnet, follow the instructions on this page to retrieve the flag:

Find the leak! - Part I 🙊

We have been hired by the Ethereum Foundation to do an assessment on what appears to be a leak inside some of their repos.

They suspect some devs mistakenly submitted some sensitive data into the geth’s repository (go-ethereum), but couldn’t figure out where, and if it is an isolated case or not.

We have forked it under theredguild/goat-ethereum, so go and take a look, see what you can find.

So far, they identified a mnemonic / seed phrase consisting of 12 words. Can you help them find it?
